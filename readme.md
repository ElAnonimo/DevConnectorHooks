# DevConnector

This is a full stack M.E.R.N application designed to showcase developer profiles listing skills, education, experience, repositories, and personal web links. A user can create, delete a developer profile, update their profile and its data. The application utilizes a remote Mongo database. It features the React.js lifecycle methods as well as use of Redux.js.
It comes with a simple forum for the users to share their thoughts and like/unlike the posts of the others.

Before launch the application please install the dependencies for both the server and client. To run the application execute `npm run dev`. Please note this command only runs in a Linux environment.
The application runs in a new browser tab on http://localhost:3000.

A live app is hosted on Heroku on https://devconnectorhooks.herokuapp.com/.
